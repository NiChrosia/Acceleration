# TODO

- [ ] Add block that deconstructs remains of unit, with % decreasing as tier increases

- [ ] Add ion collider, used for production of quark plasma

- [ ] Make sprites for: Core: Atom, metaglass walls

- [ ] Remove fusion reactor, replace with new energy generation mechanic

- [ ] Remove aerogel, its use as superlight structural support already exists as phase fabric, and insulator as cryogem/cryocatalyst.

- [ ] Move Storm, Harbinger, Flood to another mod unless I can find a spot for them in the planned turret trees
