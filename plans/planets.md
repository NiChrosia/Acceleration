# Cryogenia:

A unique frozen planet whose properties originate from not distance to a star but a strange ore found on the surface.  
The core of this planet has extreme conditions hotter than even the core of the sun.  
It contains volatile reactions capable of making quark plasma, resulting in the magnetic field being extremely strong.
