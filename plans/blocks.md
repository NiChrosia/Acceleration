## Particle Collider
Collides subatomic particles at ultrahigh speeds to create quark plasma.  
Requires large amounts of power.

## TEG Generator (Thermoelectric Generator)
Generates energy from heat fluctuations. Accepts any of the following: slag, quark plasma, and pyratite. Energy is based on temperature/flammability

## Arctifluid Mixer
Mixes fine cryogem powder with water to produce arctifluid. Requires medium amounts of power.

## Cryogem Refiner
Refines cryogems into cryocatalysts. Requires large amounts of power.
