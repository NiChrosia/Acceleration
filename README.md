# Acceleration

A JavaScript mod that exists.

Extremely unfinished, but I try to make commits whenever its stable, but is not currently meant to be played.


# Version numbers

Example: 1.0

The first number is the major content version. 0 means not ready for play, but incrementing it after 1 means the mod received major updates.

The second number is the content counter. 0 means no new blocks/liquids/items have been added, but every increment after 1 means a new object has been added.
