### Releases
Go to the releases, the latest release will have a `Acceleration.jar` attached to it that you can download. If it does not have it, go to the actions tab, click the latest workflow with a green check, and download the `.JAR` from that.
After you have the `Acceleration.jar`, paste it into your mod folder (locate your mod folder in the "open mod folder" of Mindustry).
