# Cryogenia:

A unique frozen planet whose properties originate from not distance to a star but a strange ore found on the surface.  

# Cryogem

This ore is called a cryogem due to its powerful property of extreme cold.  

## Refined cryogem: Arctifluid and Cryocatalyst

This ore can also be harnessed for use in extremely cold coolant.  
This ore can be then refined into a cryocatalyst, a powerful material used in ammunition, reactors, and special weapons.
