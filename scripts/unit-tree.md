# Turret Tree

## Controller tree

### Ion
A nimble controller ship with light energy weapons.

#### `requirements:` 
`15` - phase fabric  
`25` - titanium  
`30` - silicon

### Spark
A fast support ship, with an overclocking shield. Shoots piercing electric bullets.

#### `requirements:`
`45` - phase fabric  
`45` - silicon

### Plasma
Agile controller ship with a damaging electric aura. Shoots overloading energy bullets that sharply decrease enemy fire rate.

#### `requirements:`
`120` - phase fabric  
`90` - silicon  
`60` - plastanium

### Discharge
Controller ship with multiple shields.  
The first one is very small and surrounds a small radius around the unit, but with a high health. Takes an extremely long time to regen.  
The second has a much larger area, but significantly less health. Regenerates very rapidly.  
Shoots dual energy lasers.

### Aurora
A lithe controller ship, with a quad shield, and a revitalizing field.  
Innermost shield: Massive amount of health, ultralow regen speed. Overdrives nearby units and buildings to 200%  
Inner shield: Large amount of health, regenerates slowly.  
Outer shield: Medium amount of health, and regenerates quickly.  
Outermost shield: Small amount of health, regenerates ultrafast.

#### `requirements:`

`450` - silicon  
`300` - plastanium  
`200` - surge alloy  
`30` - arctifluid
