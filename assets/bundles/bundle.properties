## Menders
block.acceleration-configurable-projector.name = Configurable Projector
block.acceleration-configurable-projector.description = A configurable projector. Has three modes: Mend, Overdrive, and Force. \nThe mend bar represents the charge, and when it reaches the end of the bar, it mends. \nThe overdrive bar is like any other overdrive bar, it shows the overdrive percent. \nThe shield health bar shows shield health. \nThe AA checkbox represents Auto-Adjust, which will automatically adjust the setting to match power level. \nThe 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 buttons represent modes. Clicking one of them will set it to that mode.
