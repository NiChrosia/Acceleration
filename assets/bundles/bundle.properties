# Blocks

## Walls
block.acceleration-metaglass-wall.name = Metaglass Wall
block.acceleration-metaglass-wall.description = Protects structures from enemy projectiles. Refracts lasers.
block.acceleration-metaglass-wall-large.name = Large Metaglass Wall
block.acceleration-metaglass-wall-large.description = Protects structures from enemy projectiles. Refracts lasers.

## Cores
block.acceleration-atom-core.name = Core: Atom
block.acceleration-atom-core.description = Core of the base. Massive amount of armor, and gigantic resource capacity. Mends itself automatically. Has a mounted lightning turret.
block.acceleration-atom-core.details = The fourth and final iteration.

### Override Nucleus Core bundle to fit with the addition of fourth core.
block.core-nucleus.details = The third iteration.

## Menders
block.acceleration-configurable-projector.name = Configurable Projector
block.acceleration-configurable-projector.description = A configurable projector. Has three modes: Mend, Overdrive, and Force. The mend bar represents the charge, and when it reaches the end of the bar, it mends. The overdrive bar is like any other overdrive bar, it shows the overdrive percent. The shield health bar shows shield health. The AA checkbox represents Auto-Adjust, which will automatically adjust the setting to match power level. The 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 buttons represent modes. Clicking one of them will set it to that mode.
