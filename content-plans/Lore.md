# Arche

The first. Used to be a prosperous civilization, but is now reduced to ruin. What dangers lie in the depth are better left untouched.

## Cryogenic Ravine

The entryway into the deep depths. Many ruins lie here. Proceed with caution.

## Frozen Borehole

A deep borehole lies in the depths of the ravine. Frost lines the edges of it. A yawning chasm is ahead.

## Derelict Stronghold

A ruined stronghold is here. A clear path lies through the wreckage. The air is no longer cold, but rather warm. Danger lies ahead.

## Molten Cavern

A large cavern full of molten slag. An ancient defense station lies here. Most of the defenses lie derelict, yet some remain active.  
A choice, to continue to explore the ruins, or turn back, and leave the sleeping terror behind.

## Fiery Fortress

A damaged fortress lies here. Most of the defenses are active, seeming to be triggered by your intrudence. The ancient facility is rising from its slumber.

## Ancient Bastion

The last line of defense. All the defenses are active, and drones are repairing the bastion. The facility is no longer neutral, and is angered by your presence.  
Prepare for war.

## Prismatic Core

The core facility, with few defenses. The core of the planet lies nearby. Powerful controls lie here, seeming to control the entirety of Cryogenia.  
One area stands out from the rest. It is heavily damaged, and a powerful creature resides nearby. It seems to sleep for now, but may wake at any moment.  
Prevent this from happening at all costs. The planet depends on this.
