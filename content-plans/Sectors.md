# Sectors

## Glacial Glade

An ancient frozen glade situated in a tranquil zone. Contains abnormally high quantities of cryogem for its location.  
Capture the sector. Harness the resources. Move on.

Threat: `low`

### Lore:

Originally a prosperous forest, the cold has long since killed all life. Icy remains can be found.

## Cryogem Cavern

A cold and dark cave, containing numerous cryogem geodes.  
The enemy has established a resource extraction base here.  
Destroy the base.  
Leave no remaining structures.

Threat: `high`

### Lore:

This area was formed due to powerful liquids melting their way deep into the ground.  
The end of these caverns have not been found yet.

## Glacial Islands

Icy islands situated in a deep sea. Valuable arctifluid pits reside in these islands.  
This place has not yet been captured by the enemy, yet they still send large forces to attack.  
Gather as much arctifluid as possible. Move on.

Threat: `extreme`

### Lore:

Due to unique conditions, these areas have natural deposits of arctifluid.  
This area is highly desired by the enemy, and they will stop at nothing to obtain this area.

## Volcanic Canyon

An extremely volatile area containing extreme geothermal activity. The surface here damages all ground units.  
This area is rich in volcanic slag, as well as ultrahot quark plasma.  
This area also has plentiful resources, but they are well guarded.  
An extremely well defended enemy base sits here.  
Capture the base. Research the technology.

Threat: `eradication`

### Lore:

This crack in the sturdy crust of the planet was penetrated from an extremely powerful explosion from below the surface.  
More volatile events may follow. *Beware.*

## Lightning Peaks

A dangerous enemy base with special units. These units specialize in speed and lightning attacks.  
Annihilate the base. Research the technology.

Threat: `high`

### Lore:

The technology was first discovered by the enemy in mostly destroyed blueprints.  
These were found deep within the wreckage of Impact 0078, and promptly removed by the enemy to give themselves an advantage.
