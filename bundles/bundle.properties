liquid.acceleration-arctifluid.description = Used in freezing ammunition, and coolant.
liquid.acceleration-arctifluid.details = Very cold temperature. Highly damaging to units.

liquid.acceleration-quark-plasma.name = Quark Plasma
liquid.acceleration-quark-plasma.description = Used in lethal ammunition, and extreme reactions.
liquid.acceleration-quark-plasma.details = Extremely high temperature. Will cause massive damage to structures if leaked.

# Blocks

## Production

block.acceleration-arctifluid-synthesizer.name = Arctifluid Synthesizer
block.acceleration-arctifluid-synthesizer.description = Synthesizes nitrogen from the air, and supercools it using cryofluid. Requires large amounts of power.
block.acceleration-arctifluid-synthesizer.details = TODO not finished mechanics currently make about zero sense

## Turrets

block.acceleration-transistor.name = Transistor

## Environment

block.acceleration-cold-water.name = Cold Water

## Effect

block.core-nucleus.details = The third iteration.

block.acceleration-core-atom.name = Core: Atom
block.acceleration-core-atom.description = Core of the base. Massive amount of armor, and gigantic resource capacity. Mends itself automatically. Has a mounted lightning turret.
block.acceleration-core-atom.details = The fourth and final iteration.

## Walls

block.acceleration-metaglass-wall.name = Metaglass Wall
block.acceleration-metaglass-wall.description = Protects structures from enemy projectiles. Refracts lasers.

block.acceleration-metaglass-wall-large.name = Large Metaglass Wall

block.acceleration-capacitor.name = Capacitor

# Settings

setting.status-zone.name = Puddle / Bullet Status Zone

# Campaign

## Planets

planet.acceleration-cryogenia.name = Cryogenia
planet.acceleration-cryogenia.description = An abnormally cold planet. Powerful freezing technology resulted in extreme temperatures, causing snow and ice to be very common. This further resulted in lower temperatures, due to the reflectivity of them.

## Sectors
